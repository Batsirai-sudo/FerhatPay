 * Checks the type of the device as a

On Android, for devices other than TVs,

(screen diagonal size), so the result may not be completely 
accurate. If the screen diagonal length is between 3" and
 6.9", the method returns DeviceType.PHONE. For lengths 
 between 7" and 18", the method returns DeviceType.TABLET.
  Otherwise, the method returns DeviceType.UNKNOWN.
Returns
Returns a promise that resolves to a Device.DeviceType enum value.
Examples
An enum of the different types of devices supported by Expo, 
with these values:
UNKNOWN -- An unrecognized device type
PHONE -- Mobile phone handsets, typically with a touch screen
 and held in one hand
TABLET -- Tablet computers, typically with a touch screen that
 is larger than a phone's
DESKTOP -- Desktop or laptop computers, typically with a keyboard
 and mouse
TV -- TV-based interfaces
